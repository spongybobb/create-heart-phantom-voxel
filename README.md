# create-heart-phantom-voxel
 The difference between this repo and 'create-a-heart-phantom' is that this version creates the phantoms in voxel space instead of surface representation
 
 VObjgenerator.ipynb is adapted from VObjgenerator.m
 
 VObjgenerator.m creates .mat file containing a phantom
 
 makesphericalvoxelphantom.m provides visualisation of the phantom.
